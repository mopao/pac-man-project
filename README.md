# Pac-Man Game

## Description

Pac-Man is a video game; the player controls the eponymous character through an enclosed maze. 
The objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding the red ghosts that pursue him. When Pac-Man eats all of the dots, the player advances to the next level. If Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when all lives are lost. Red ghosts are directed by  artificial intelligence (A.I.).
